# SLAM-dockerfile-cheatsheet

## Motivation  
SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) have different dependencies for each algorithm. Adjusting these all dependencies to the local computer is very challenging. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a powerful tool, you could solve these problem at once.   

This repository helps you to make Dockerfile easier what you want.

## Useful Dockerfile commands  
Supported by ChatGPT & [Reference](https://biocorecrg.github.io/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/docker-recipes.html) 
- **`FROM`** : Specifies the base image that will be used for the Docker image.  
- **`WORKDIR`** : Sets the working directory for subsequent commands in the Dockerfile. 
- **`RUN`** : Runs a command inside the Docker image during the build process. This can be used to install packages, run scripts, and perform other setup tasks. 
- **`COPY`** or **`ADD`** :  Copies files from the host machine to the Docker image. This can be used to add application code, configuration files, and other assets to the image.
- **`ENV`** : Sets environment variables inside the Docker image.  
- **`CMD`** or **`ENTRYPOINT`**: Specifies the command that will be executed when the container is started. `CMD` is used to specify a default command, while `ENTRYPOINT` is used to specify a command that should always be run when the container is started.

# VINS-Mono-docker-tutorial

There is a dockerfile on the [original repository](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono), but the explanation is unfriendly for beginners.  

I use another docker image and dataset.  

I've also uploaded a step-by-step tutorial on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/DzbHQzd45TU).  

## Requirements  
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)  
- [terminator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/terminator-a-linux-terminal-emulator/) (High recommended)  

## Dataset  

- [OpenLORIS-Scene Dataset](https://lifelong-robotic-vision.github.io/dataset/scene.html)  

> If you want to use this dataset, you need to fix some bag files.  
> Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/lifelong-robotic-vision/OpenLORIS-Scene/issues/15).  

**When you make dataset, you have to know where it is (Absolute path will be used).**  

```
@inproceedings{shi2019openlorisscene,
    title={Are We Ready for Service Robots? The {OpenLORIS-Scene} Datasets for Lifelong {SLAM}},

    pages={3139-3145},
}
```

## Clone VINS-Mono repository  

You could use original [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) repository,  
but I make my own [VINS-MONO-studying](https://github.com/Taeyoung96/VINS-MONO-studying).  

I added config file for OpenLORIS-Scene dataset, and change the file format of `vins_result_loop.csv` like **[TUM RGB-D dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/file_formats)**. 


```
git clone https://github.com/Taeyoung96/VINS-MONO-studying.git  
```
**Also, you should know where it is (Absolute path will be used).**  

## Pull the docker image  

I used [icra2018/vins-mono](https://hub.docker.com/r/icra2018/vins-mono) docker image.  

```
docker pull icra2018/vins-mono
```

When the Docker image pull is completed, the output is as follows when input as shown below.  

```
docker images
```
Output:
```
REPOSITORY           TAG                    IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
icra2018/vins-mono   latest                 1dc54987f8fe   2 years ago    4.95GB
```

## Make your own container  

You have to use your own absolute path, when you run the command below.  

```
nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e DISPLAY -w /home/jovyan/catkin_ws/src -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
-v [Absolute path of Dataset]:/dataset \
-v [Absolute path of VINS-Mono repository]:/home/jovyan/catkin_ws/src/ \
--name vins-mono icra2018/vins-mono:latest /bin/bash
```

When you are done, the terminal will be changed like below.  

```
jovyan@e9663ba248d6:~/catkin_ws/src$ 
```
Type ls and you should see the VINS-Mono folder.  
```
jovyan@e9663ba248d6:~/catkin_ws/src$ ls
VINS-Mono
```

Change the directory and build it.  
```
jovyan@e9663ba248d6:~/catkin_ws/src$ cd ..
jovyan@e9663ba248d6:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make 
```

When you are done you would see the outputs below.  
```
[  3%] Built target benchmark_publisher
[ 23%] Built target camera_model
[ 44%] Built target Calibration
[ 47%] Built target ar_demo_node
[ 53%] Built target feature_tracker
[ 78%] Built target vins_estimator
[100%] Built target pose_graph
...
```

Then run roscore.  

```
jovyan@e9663ba248d6:~/catkin_ws$ roscore  
```

Now you need to connect to the Docker container using the other 3 terminals.  

- 2nd Terminal : launch vins_estimator     
- 3rd Terminal : launch Rviz  
- 4nd Terminal : play rosbag file  

Before connecting other terminals to the container, type the command below to use the GUI.
```
xhost +local:docker
```

2nd Terminal :  
```
docker exec -it -w /home/jovyan/catkin_ws/ vins-mono /bin/bash
```
When connecting to a docker container,  
The launch file is in [VINS-MONO-studying](https://github.com/Taeyoung96/VINS-MONO-studying).  
```
roslaunch vins_estimator realsense_color_cafe.launch
```

3rd Terminal :  
```
docker exec -it -w /home/jovyan/catkin_ws/ vins-mono /bin/bash
```
When connecting to a docker container,  
```
roslaunch vins_estimator vins_rviz.launch
```

4nd Terminal :   
```
docker exec -it -w /dataset vins-mono /bin/bash  
```
When connecting to a docker container,  
```
rosbag play cafe1-1_with_imu.bag
```
This bag file was created by myself using the OpenLORIS-Scene dataset.
